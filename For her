Hi, love. This is for you. I am not really good at this but I guess, I'll do it anyway. The first time that I saw you, I didn't know that I will get your attention. Maybe because for me, I am just no one? Yet you saw me. You didn't hesitate to accept my flaws. You accepted me for who I am. You didn't hesitate to touch the broken part of me. You love them deeply— you accepted them with all your heart and mind. God knows how lucky I am for having you in my life and I hope you know how much I love you. I hope you know how much love I have for you since then. Loving you is one of the best decision I've ever made. Loving you didn't fail me. Loving you made me realized that after those trauma, I am still able to love the way I wanna be loved. Your love didn't fail me and it's one of my favorite part about you— about us.
For them, it's a bare minimum but for me, it's everything. You're everything I wanted and I want you to live your life with me. I wanna see you pursuing your dreams while you're with me— while we're still with each other. I used to believe that I am too hard to love but you changed that. You healed some part of me even though it is not your responsibility and I thank you for that. I see the way you're loving me and I appreciate it. Now, I hope that you feel the same way. Sana napaparamdam ko rin kung gano kita kamahal at mamahalin pa kita sa mga susunod na araw.
I love you so much, Aein. Let me marry you.
