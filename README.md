"A Christmas Whisper Meant for You”
Helloo Cj! 

How are u doing diha? Are u okay? Please be safe, as always. 

After we had our convo (July 11, 2025),  I am starting to like u again. First, I’m a bit confused by my feelings but katung ni lakaw naka for seminary, mag sigi nako ug pangita nimo. I know nga we’re not that close pajud since this year pata naka talk, pero para nako dugay na tang friends or unsa idk how to say it. Basta, I always find myself looking for u, even in the smallest ways whether mo check ko if online ka, or simply hoping to hear from you.

I am grateful for the times i get to see you sa church before. You’ve become someone I always look forward to.
I really miss u.
Your presence always makes my day brighter.

As we celebrate this season (my favorite season 🥹) I also pray nimo and sa imo fam that are blessed with peace and joy. 

Wishing you and ur family na mag enjoy mo and have a meaningful Christmas.

Merry Christmas, Cj!🎄❤️
