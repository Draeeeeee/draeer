"i hope you read this, even if it's too late."
i don't know if you'll ever read this. maybe it’ll just get lost in the noise of everything else, like how we did. but if you do stumble on it somehow, i just wanted you to know that i still think about you. not every second, not obsessively—but in those quiet gaps of the day, when the world slows down and i catch myself reaching for something that isn’t there anymore. it’s always you.
we really tried, didn’t we? gave it everything we could at the time, but the universe never gave us enough room to breathe, enough space to be “us” without all the weight crushing down. and i hate that, because it wasn’t about a lack of love. it was about timing, about circumstances we couldn’t bend, about how sometimes two people can want each other so badly but still not fit into the same story yet.
i just wondered if i met you not during this broken pieces of me… maybe things would’ve turned out different. maybe i could’ve held you with steady hands instead of trembling ones. maybe i wouldn’t have made you feel the weight of all the battles i was still fighting inside.
timing has always been cruel to us. you came into my life like light through a cracked window—warm, needed, but never enough to fill the whole room. and i know, deep down, it wasn’t love that failed us, it was the version of me you met. the version that was still trying to stitch myself back together, still bleeding through the seams.
if only you had met the version of me that wasn’t so heavy, the one who could have matched your love without hesitation… maybe we’d still be here. maybe i’d still get to wake up knowing i hadn’t ruined the safest thing i ever held.
but there’s some kind of quiet hope in me that whispers—this isn’t the end. maybe one day, when i’m no longer shattered, when i’ve learned how to love without hurting… i’ll cross paths with you again. and if that happens, i’ll love you in a way that won’t make you doubt staying.
until then, you’ll always be my “what if,” the ache i carry, and the reason i keep trying to heal.
wherever you are now, i just hope you’re okay. i hope life is kinder to you than it ever was to us. i hope your mornings feel lighter, that you wake up with more peace than heaviness in your chest. i hope you laugh without holding back, the kind of laugh that makes your eyes disappear and your cheeks hurt. i hope you’ve found people who remind you how lovable you are without you ever having to question it.
i hope your nights aren’t filled with the same battles we used to fight, that you get to rest without overthinking, without tears soaking your pillow. i hope you’re surrounded by warmth—whether it’s from friends, family, or someone new who makes you feel safe in ways i couldn’t.
i hope you’re chasing dreams that once felt too far away, and i hope you’re proud of yourself for how far you’ve come, even if you don’t always see it. i hope you’ve found a version of happiness that doesn’t leave you wondering when it’ll fall apart.
and selfishly, i hope when the world quiets down, you still think of me sometimes—not with anger or regret, but with a soft smile, like a memory that was painful yet still beautiful. even if i never see you again, knowing you’re okay will always matter to me.
