hi, i don't even know if you'll ever
read this. But i guess I'll continue.


hi, bao. How are you, are you okay?
it's always been you. I can't moved on
i can't stop thinking about you. 
Do you know na it's exhausting seeing 
you happy with him na it's supposed to
be me, bao. I can't stand it, it hurts 
so much. I don't know what happen to your
life anymore, i don't know if you still
love the color you told me, the food
that you told me, the music and more



I miss you so much, i can't stop thinking 
our past, our memories. If only i can
turn back the time, I'll love you more
the way i loved you. I know that you 
already taken but if he breaks your 
heart dont hesitate to text me and come
back to me, bao. I'm always here
waiting for you. i love you do much, baobi.
